- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Dea Tabakovic. I recently graduated from the IT Academy in Summer 2023. I've learned Quality Assurance and software testing.
â€” ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in manual testing, and I have a very good eye for detail and a lot of persistence that guides me through any project I'm testing.
â€” ðŸŒ± I have a strong tendency towards automation. I am currently practicing automation using Selenium driver and API testing using Postman.
â€” ðŸ‘€  I also have interest in programming and building websites, so I am also learning skills using WordPress.
       Python is a programming language I like and practice with small projects on my own.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ...
